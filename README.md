Certainly! Here are some recommendations for enhancing the `README.md` file to include comprehensive documentation as per the requirement. I will amend the `README.md` to include:

1. Project structure and dependencies.
2. Detailed steps to set up the development environment.
3. Diagrams and screenshots to illustrate the architecture and workflow.
4. Guidelines for troubleshooting and debugging.
5. Group members' names.

### Amended `README.md`

## Overview

This project is a full-stack Netflix clone application designed to showcase the use of modern web technologies and cloud infrastructure. The application fetches movie data from the TMDB API and displays it in a Netflix-like interface.

## Architecture

The application is structured as follows:

![Architecture Diagram](architecture-diagram.png)

### Architecture Components

1. **Frontend (React)**:
   - **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
   - **S3**: AWS Simple Storage Service, used to host the static files for the frontend.
   - **CloudFront**: AWS Content Delivery Network (CDN), used to deliver the frontend content globally with low latency.

2. **Backend (Node.js with Express)**:
   - **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
   - **Express**: A web application framework for Node.js, used to build the RESTful API.
   - **Docker**: Used to containerize the backend application for consistent deployment.
   - **ECR**: AWS Elastic Container Registry, used to store Docker images.
   - **ECS**: AWS Elastic Container Service, used to run the Docker containers.
   - **API Gateway**: AWS API Gateway, used to expose the backend services.

3. **Infrastructure (Terraform)**:
   - **Terraform**: An infrastructure as code tool used to provision and manage the AWS resources.
   - **IAM**: AWS Identity and Access Management, used to manage access to AWS services and resources.
   - **VPC, Subnets, Security Groups**: AWS Virtual Private Cloud, used to create a secure network environment.

4. **CI/CD (GitHub Actions)**:
   - **GitHub Actions**: Used for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) to automate the build, test, and deployment process.

5. **External API**:
   - **TMDB API**: The Movie Database API, used to fetch movie data for the application.

## Dependencies

### Frontend

- React
- React DOM
- Babel
- Webpack
- Jest

### Backend

- Express
- Axios
- Jest

### Infrastructure

- Terraform
- AWS CLI

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate credentials

### Environment Variables

Set the following environment variables in your GitHub repository secrets and locally as needed:

- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
- `DOCKER_USERNAME`
- `DOCKER_PASSWORD`
- `AWS_ACCOUNT_ID`
- `AWS_REGION` (us-east-1)
- `TMDB_API_KEY`

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
   ```sh
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Initialize the project and install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the frontend application:
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the `backend` directory:
   ```sh
   cd backend
   ```

2. Initialize the project and install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the backend application:
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

### Docker Setup

1. Ensure you have Docker installed and running.

2. Build and run the Docker containers:
   ```sh
   docker-compose up
   ```

### Terraform Setup

1. Navigate to the appropriate infrastructure directory (`dev`, `stage`, or `prod`):
   ```sh
   cd infrastructure/dev
   ```

2. Initialize Terraform:
   ```sh
   terraform init
   ```

3. Apply the Terraform configuration:
   ```sh
   terraform apply -var="docker_image_tag=latest"
   ```

## Branching Strategy

The branching strategy for this project is as follows:

1. **`prod`**: Production branch
2. **`stage`**: Staging branch, merges from `dev`
3. **`dev`**: Development branch, merges from feature branches
4. **`feature/*`**: Feature branches, branched from `dev` and merge back into `dev`

## CI/CD Pipeline

The CI/CD pipeline is defined using GitHub Actions and includes the following workflows:

- **Build and Test**: Runs on every push to any branch
- **Deploy to Dev**: Runs on push to `dev` branch
- **Deploy to Stage**: Runs on push to `stage` branch
- **Deploy to Prod**: Runs on push to `prod` branch

For detailed configuration, see the [GitHub Actions workflow file](.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml).

## Destroying the Infrastructure

To destroy the infrastructure for each environment, you can use the following GitHub Actions workflow.

For detailed configuration, see the [GitHub Actions destroy workflow file](.github/workflows/destroy.yml).

## Troubleshooting and Debugging

### Common Issues

1. **Error: Network connection issues**
   - Ensure that your AWS credentials are correctly configured.
   - Verify that your network allows connections to AWS services.

2. **Error: Docker container not starting**
   - Check the Docker logs for more information: `docker logs <container_id>`
   - Ensure that the Docker service is running on your machine.

3. **Error: Terraform apply fails**
   - Check the Terraform logs for more details.
   - Ensure that your AWS credentials have the necessary permissions.

### Debugging Tips

- Use `console.log` in Node.js and `console.debug` in React to log useful debugging information.
- Use breakpoints and the debugger in your IDE to step through your code.
