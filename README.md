### Documentation

#### docs/architecture.md
```markdown
# Network Architecture

The architecture consists of the following components:

- **Users**: End users interact with the application through a web interface.
- **Route 53**: AWS Route 53 is used for DNS management, directing user traffic to the appropriate endpoints.
- **API Gateway**: AWS API Gateway handles the routing and exposure of RESTful APIs created by AWS Lambda functions.
- **Lambda**: AWS Lambda functions execute the backend logic in a serverless environment, handling requests and interacting with other AWS services.
- **DynamoDB**: AWS DynamoDB is a NoSQL database used to store application data, such as user profiles and movie details.
- **SQS**: AWS Simple Queue Service (SQS) is used for decoupling microservices and managing message queues for asynchronous processing.
- **SNS**: AWS Simple Notification Service (SNS) is used to send notifications and messages to users or other systems.
- **TMDB API**: An external API used to fetch movie data, including details, search results, and other relevant information. It is integrated into the backend application using the `utils.py` module.
- **Docker**: Docker is used to containerize the application, ensuring portability and consistency across different environments.
- **ECR**

: AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR) is used to store and manage Docker images.
- **ECS**: AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS) is used to run containerized applications. It works with EC2 to provide scalable compute capacity.
- **EC2**: AWS EC2 instances provide the underlying compute capacity for running the ECS cluster and other resources.
- **Kubernetes**: Kubernetes is used for container orchestration, managing the deployment, scaling, and operations of containerized applications.
- **Terraform**: Terraform is used for managing infrastructure as code, automating the setup and configuration of all the necessary AWS resources.

- Users can add movies to their watchlist from the movie details page and view or manage their watchlist from their profile page.

### Receiving Notifications
- Users receive notifications about new movies, updates, or personalized recommendations.

## Security and Reliability

### Authentication
- Secure user authentication and authorization are implemented to protect user data.

### Data Privacy
- User data is stored securely in DynamoDB, and access is restricted.

### Scalability
- The application uses AWS ECS and EC2 to ensure it can handle varying loads.

### Automation
- CI/CD pipelines automate testing and deployment, ensuring rapid and reliable updates.

## Future Enhancements

- **User Reviews and Ratings**: Allow users to leave reviews and rate movies.
- **Recommendation Engine**: Suggest movies based on user preferences and watch history.
- **Video Streaming**: Integrate video streaming capabilities directly into the application.
- **Offline Mode**: Enable users to download movies for offline viewing.
- **Multi-language Support**: Add support for multiple languages to cater to a broader audience.

## Conclusion
This document provides an overview of the features and user experience of the Netflix clone application. It highlights the key functionalities, backend operations, and the secure and scalable infrastructure supporting the application. Future enhancements aim to further enrich the user experience and expand the application's capabilities.

2. **Configure AWS CLI**:
   ```bash
   aws configure
   ```

3. **Build and Push Docker Image**:
   ```bash
   docker build -t netflix-clone ./backend
   docker tag netflix-clone:latest <AWS_ACCOUNT_ID>.dkr.ecr.<AWS_REGION>.amazonaws.com/group-3-ecr-netflix-clone:latest
   docker push <AWS_ACCOUNT_ID>.dkr.ecr.<AWS_REGION>.amazonaws.com/group-3-ecr-netflix-clone:latest
   ```

4. **Deploy Infrastructure using Terraform**:
   ```bash
   cd terraform
   terraform init
   terraform apply -auto-approve
   ```

5. **Create Kubernetes Secret for TMDB API Key**:
   ```bash
   kubectl create secret generic tmdb-api-key-secret --from-literal=TMDB_API_KEY=your_tmdb_api_key
   ```

6. **Deploy to Kubernetes**:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f ./kubernetes
   ```

## CI/CD Pipeline

The CI/CD pipeline is managed using GitHub Actions and includes the following workflows:

### CI/CD Workflow (ci-cd.yml)

- Builds, tests, and deploys the application on every push or pull request to the `dev`, `main`, or `feature/*` branches.
1. **Build and push Docker image**:
   - Uses Docker to build the image and pushes it to AWS ECR.
2. **Deploy to ECR**:
   - Tags and pushes the Docker image to AWS Elastic Container Registry.
3. **Terraform Apply**:
   - Deploys infrastructure using Terraform.
4. **Deploy to Kubernetes**:
   - Applies Kubernetes configurations for deployment and service.

### Destroy Workflow (destroy.yml)

- Destroys all resources created in AWS.
1. **Terraform Destroy**:
   - Destroys all infrastructure resources created by Terraform.

## Network Architecture

The architecture consists of the following components:

- **Users**: End users interact with the application through a web interface.
- **Route 53**: AWS Route 53 is used for DNS management, directing user traffic to the appropriate endpoints.
- **API Gateway**: AWS API Gateway handles the routing and exposure of RESTful APIs created by AWS Lambda functions.
- **Lambda**: AWS Lambda functions execute the backend logic in a serverless environment, handling requests and interacting with other AWS services.
- **DynamoDB**: AWS DynamoDB is a NoSQL database used to store application data, such as user profiles and movie details.
- **SQS**: AWS Simple Queue Service (SQS) is used for decoupling microservices and managing message queues for asynchronous processing.
- **SNS**: AWS Simple Notification Service (SNS) is used to send notifications and messages to users or other systems.
- **TMDB API**: An external API used to fetch movie data, including details, search results, and other relevant information. It is integrated into the backend application using the `utils.py` module.
- **Docker**: Docker is used to containerize the application, ensuring portability and consistency across different environments.
- **ECR**: AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR) is used to store and manage Docker images.
- **ECS**: AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS) is used to run containerized applications. It works with EC2 to provide scalable compute capacity.
- **EC2**: AWS EC2 instances provide the underlying compute capacity for running the ECS cluster and other resources.
- **Kubernetes**: Kubernetes is used for container orchestration, managing the deployment, scaling, and operations of containerized applications.
- **Terraform**: Terraform is used for managing infrastructure as code, automating the setup and configuration of all the necessary AWS resources.
